# Change a Serverless Project to Shift Traffic Between AWS Lambda Function Versions<a name="how-to-modify-serverless-project"></a>

AWS CodeDeploy supports function version deployments for AWS Lambda functions in your AWS CodeStar serverless projects\. An AWS Lambda deployment shifts incoming traffic from an existing Lambda function to an updated Lambda function version\. You might want to test an updated Lambda function by deploying a separate version and then rolling back the deployment to the first version if needed\.

Use the steps in this section to modify your AWS CodeStar project template and update your CodeStarWorker roleâ€™s IAM permissions\. This task starts an automated response in AWS CloudFormation that creates aliased AWS Lambda functions and then instructs AWS CodeDeploy to shift traffic to an updated environment\.

AWS CodeDeploy has three deployment options that allow you to shift traffic to versions of your AWS Lambda function in your application:
+ **Canary: **Traffic is shifted in two increments\. You can choose from predefined canary options that specify the percentage of traffic shifted to your updated Lambda function version in the first increment and the interval, in minutes, before the remaining traffic is shifted in the second increment\.
+ **Linear: **Traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment\. You can choose from predefined linear options that specify the percentage of traffic shifted in each incrememnt and the number of minutes between each increment\. Traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment\. You can choose from predefined linear options that specify the percentage of traffic shifted in each increment and the number of minutes between each increment\.
+ **All\-at\-once: **All traffic is shifted from the original Lambda function to the updated Lambda function version at once\.

**Prerequisites: **

You can start with an existing serverless project in AWS CodeStar, or you can create a new serverless project in AWS CodeStar and then complete these steps\. To create a serverless project, when selecting the template in AWS CodeStar, select any template with the Lambda compute platform\.

**Topics**

**Step 1: To modify the SAM template to add AWS Lambda version deployment parameters**

1. Open the AWS CodeStar console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codestar/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codestar/)\.

1. Choose your existing serverless project and then open the **Code** page\. In the top level of your repository, note the location of the SAM template named `template.yml` to be modified\.

1. Open the `template.yml` file in your IDE or local repository\. Add a new `Globals` section by copying this text\. The sample text in this tutorial chooses the Canary10Percent5Minutes option\.

   ```
   Globals:
     Function:
       AutoPublishAlias: live
       DeploymentPreference: 
         Enabled: true
         Type: Canary10Percent5Minutes
   ```

   This example shows a modified template after the `Globals` section has been added:

   For more information, see the [Globals Section](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/docs/globals.rst) reference guide for serverless application model \(SAM\) templates\. 

**Step 2: To edit the CloudFormation role to add permissions**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CodeStar console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codestar/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codestar/)\.
**Note**  
You must sign in to the AWS Management Console using credentials associated with the IAM user you created or identified in [Setting Up AWS CodeStar](setting-up.md)\. This user must have the AWS managed policy named **AWSCodeStarFullAccess** attached\.

1. Choose your existing serverless project and then open the Project resources page\.

1. Under **Resources**, choose the IAM role created for the CodeStarWorker/AWS CloudFormation role\. The role opens in the IAM console\. 
**Note**  
You must complete the following steps with administrator privileges that allow you to add permissions in IAM\.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, in **Inline Policies**, in the row for your service role policy, choose **Edit Policy**\. Choose the **JSON** tab to edit the policy in JSON format\.
**Note**  
Your service role has this name: `CodeStarWorkerCloudFormationRolePolicy`\.

1. Add the following policy statements in the **JSON** box within the `Statement` element\. Replace the *region* and *id* placeholders with your region and account ID\.

   ```
   {
     "Action": [
       "s3:GetObject",
       "s3:GetObjectVersion",
       "s3:GetBucketVersioning"
     ],
     "Resource": "*",
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "s3:PutObject"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::codepipeline*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "lambda:*"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:lambda:region:id:function:*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "apigateway:*"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:apigateway:region::*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "iam:GetRole",
       "iam:CreateRole",
       "iam:DeleteRole",
       "iam:PutRolePolicy"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:iam::id:role/*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
       "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
       "iam:DetachRolePolicy"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:iam::id:role/*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "iam:PassRole"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "codedeploy:CreateApplication",
       "codedeploy:DeleteApplication",
       "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:codedeploy:region:id:application:*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "codedeploy:CreateDeploymentGroup",
       "codedeploy:CreateDeployment",
       "codedeploy:DeleteDeploymentGroup",
       "codedeploy:GetDeployment"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:codedeploy:region:id:deploymentgroup:*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   },
   {
     "Action": [
       "codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:codedeploy:region:id:deploymentconfig:*"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow"
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Review policy** to ensure the policy contains no errors\. When the policy is error\-free, choose **Save changes**\.

**Step 3: To commit and push your template change to start the AWS Lambda version shift**

1. Commit and push the changes in the template\.yml file that you saved in Step 1\.
**Note**  
This will start your pipeline\. If you commit the changes before updating IAM permissions, your pipeline starts and CloudFormation stack creation encounters errors, which will roll back the stack creation\. If this happens, restart your pipeline after permissions have been corrected\.

1. When the pipeline for your project starts the deployment stage, the AWS CloudFormation stack creation starts\. You can select the AWS CloudFormation stage in your pipeline on your AWS CodeStar dashboard to see the stack creation notice when deployment is started\.

   During stack creation, AWS CloudFormation automatically updates the project resources as follows:
   + AWS CloudFormation processes the template\.yml file by creating aliased Lambda functions, event hooks, and resources\.
   + AWS CloudFormation calls Lambda to create the new version of the function\.
   + AWS CloudFormation creates an AppSpec file and calls AWS CodeDeploy to shift the traffic\.

   For more information on publishing aliased Lambda functions in the serverless application model \(SAM\), see the [AWS Serverless Application Model \(SAM\)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md) template reference\. For more information about event hooks and resources in the AWS CodeDeploy AppSpec file, see [AppSpec 'resources' Section \(AWS Lambda Deployments Only\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-resources.html) and [AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an AWS Lambda Deployment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.html#appspec-hooks-lambda)\.

1. After successful completion of your pipeline, the resources are created in your AWS CloudFormation stack\. In the **Project Resources ** list on the **Project** page in AWS CodeStar, view the AWS CodeDeploy application, the AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, and the AWS CodeDeploy service role resources created for your project\.

1. Make a change in your Lambda function in your repository to create a new version\. The new deployment starts and shifts traffic according to the deployment type indicated in the SAM template\. You can view the status of the deployment\. In the **Project Resources ** list on the **Project** page in AWS CodeStar, choose the link to the AWS CodeDeploy deployment to view the status of the traffic shifting to the new version\.

1. In your local working directory, you can make changes to your AWS Lambda function and commit the change to your project repository\. AWS CloudFormation supports AWS CodeDeploy in managing the next revision in the same way\.
